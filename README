There is a template widget in plugin's content folder but it has HTML GET Request nodes from Low Entry.
If you need to view online pdf files, you need to use an HTML plugin with ByteArray support. If you have another one or you use only local PDFs, just delete that nodes.

Even if you don't want to view online PDF files, you need to attach an empty array to ByteArray pin of Read PDF function. You can use "Make Array" node.
